# Analysing Dialogue Exchange Patterns in Friends Using Relationship-Focused Chord Visualizations

## Introduction 

This project examines **dialogue flow and character interaction intensity** in *FRIENDS* using a **Chord Diagram** to visualize average words exchanged per season. The goal is to identify **narrative anchors, dominant relationships, and interaction gaps** across the main cast.

Rather than ranking characters by total dialogue alone, the analysis focuses on **who interacts with whom; and how strongly**.



## Why a Chord Diagram 

A chord diagram was chosen to:
 - Emphasize relationship strength
 - Surface imbalances in character interactions
 - Provide instant visual clarity on dominant and weak connections

📌 Design Constraint: *Chord diagrams are ideal for small-to-medium networks where visual storytelling outweighs numeric precision*.



## Key Insights 

### Dominant Relationships
  - **Ross–Rachel** lead all pairs in average word exchange
  - **Monica–Chandler** rank second, reflecting sustained conversational depth
  - Romantic pairings clearly dominate narrative dialogue volume
