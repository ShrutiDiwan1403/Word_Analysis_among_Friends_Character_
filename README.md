# Analysing Dialogue Exchange Patterns in Friends Using Relationship-Focused Chord Visualizations

## Introduction 

This project examines **dialogue flow and character interaction intensity** in ***FRIENDS*** using a **Chord Diagram** to visualize average words exchanged per season. The goal is to identify **narrative anchors, dominant relationships, and interaction gaps** across the main cast.

Rather than ranking characters by total dialogue alone, the analysis focuses on **who interacts with whom; and how strongly**.



## Why a Chord Diagram 

A chord diagram was chosen to:
 - Emphasize relationship strength
 - Surface imbalances in character interactions
 - Provide instant visual clarity on dominant and weak connections

📌 Design Constraint: *Chord diagrams are ideal for small-to-medium networks where visual storytelling outweighs numeric precision*.



## Key Insights 

### Dominant Relationships
  - **Ross–Rachel** lead all pairs in average word exchange
  - **Monica–Chandler** rank second, reflecting sustained conversational depth
  - Romantic pairings clearly dominate narrative dialogue volume

📌 Insight: Dialogue distribution reinforces the show’s core relationship arcs.


### Weak & Peripheral Interactions
  - **Chandler → Phoebe** recorded the **lowest dialogue volume (128 words)**
  - **Chandler–Rachel** interactions are minimal across the season

📌 Insight: *Despite ensemble status, character connectivity is uneven and story-driven*.



## Strategic Takeaway 

Dialogue volume aligns strongly with **narrative importance**, not equal screen time. A small number of relationships carry the majority of conversational weight, shaping audience perception and plot momentum.


## Conclusion 

This visualization demonstrates how **relational analytics** can reveal storytelling structure. By prioritizing interaction strength over raw counts, the chord diagram surfaces the true conversational backbone of Friends.
